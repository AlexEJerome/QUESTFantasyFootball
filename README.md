# QUESTASY FOOTBALL RANKER

This was a fun one. Had to combine 28 teams from two different leagues on ESPN into 1 data set to rank the entire league.
The ranker is in [notebooks/combined stats](notebooks/Combined Stats.ipynb), and there's some fun boxplot visualizations in [notebooks/Box Plots](notebooks/Box Plots.ipynb)
The command for docker on my computer is in ["command to run.txt"](command to run.txt)
